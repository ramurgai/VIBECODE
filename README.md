## What did you build?
I built a modified version of the snake game. There are power up apples that give you two points and increase your speed. There is also a cool background that is the current game you're playing. There is a leaderboard like in an arcade game and you toggle playing snake with walls or without them.

## What language(s) or tools did you use?
I used Javascript and HTML.

## Which AI tools did you use, and how?
I used ChatGPT. I prompted it to write all the code and went through lots of different prompts bit by bit to keep adding features. I had a direction and I used the AI to get me to where I wanted to go and facilitate that goal.

## What did you do versus what AI helped with?
I did nothing but prompt engineering. I asked ChatGPT what I wanted to accomplish and if it didn't do what I asked I simply found what wasn't working then prompted it to fix that part. 

## What’s one thing you’re proud of?
I'm not really proud of much considering I don't really feel like I did anything. I do think that the background where you see your game running is pretty cool though.

## What’s one thing you’d improve with more time?
I'd probably flesh out the game a lot more. Snake already exists as a game and while I did add some stuff to it it's a bit of a known concept. If I had more time I would probably make a new set of mechanics that would make the game a little bit more unique.
